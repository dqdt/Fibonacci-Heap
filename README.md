# Fibonacci-Heap
A naive implementation

Motivation:
This problem could be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm:

and it is called the "widest path problem" or "minimax path problem":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widest_path_problem

I ran into time limit issues, and a Fibonacci heap was a way to speed up Dijkstra's.

I followed this explanation:
